# README

This project was a homework assignment for the Iron Yard to practice using Bootstrap inside an MVC app by creating sports website based on specified prototype.

### Deliverables

This assignment was designed to practice both using Bootstrap and creating a database through Entity Framework. The design intended to be replicated is at the following link: https://github.com/TIY-NET-Tampa/bootstrap-design

Level 1

- Use bootstrap to reproduce the design
- You do not need to add any additional CSS to achieve this design
- Remove all the old content from the index page and place your new HTML there
- Don't worry about making the data dynamic for this level.
- Do not vary from the design as provided, add nothing, and leave nothing out. Your design doesn't need to be pixel perfect, but with bootstrap it shouldn't be far off.

Level 2

- Create a ViewModel for the site. Every item that could be dynamic should be represented in this view model
- Pass the view model down from the controller to the cshtml already populated with data

Level 3

- Create a Database to support this site using EF and Make the HomePage Actually Dynamic
